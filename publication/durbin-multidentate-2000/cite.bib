 abstract = {PURPOSE To identify the most effective multidentate 1,2-HOPO and Me-3,2-HOPO ligands for chelation of Pu(IV) in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two sets of ligands with four identical backbones were prepared containing two, three or four bidentate 1,2-HOPO or Me-3,2-HOPO groups, and 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) was resynthesized in a higher yielding procedure. They were evaluated in mouse for acute toxicity and reduction of tissue 238Pu, in comparison with CaNa3-DTPA (30 micromol kg(-1)). RESULTS Nine HOPO ligands, promptly injected or given orally or injected at low dosage, are superior to CaNa3-DTPA for reducing 238Pu retention in mouse. Five, given by delayed injection or promptly injected or orally administered as ferric complexes, are superior to CaNa3-DTPA or FeNa2-DTPA respectively. The Me-3,2-HOPO ligands are more effective than their structural 1,2-HOPO analogues, demonstrating the greater affinity of Me-3,2-HOPO for Pu(IV) in vivo. CONCLUSIONS The most efficacious ligand, 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO), contains the less stably binding 1,2-HOPO group; therefore, its linear spermine backbone must confer advantages for Pu(IV) binding (greater solubility, more favorable arrangement of ligating groups, more flexible backbone). Effective low toxicity tetradentate 5-LIO(Me-3,2-HOPO) and hexadentate TREN-(Me-3,2-HOPO) and highly effective but moderately toxic 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO) (LD50 approximately 300 micromol kg(-1) in mouse) are recommended for further investigation.},
